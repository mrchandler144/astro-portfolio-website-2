One of my pastimes is to use my coding skills to make small games. I find this is a great way to keep my skills fresh and relevant, and make cool projects that I can show off later.

Some of my work is published on my itch.io page, linked below. By far the largest project I've worked on is ChessGPT, an adversarial chess simulator with a simple twist: the AI is allowed to cheat. Inspired by playing chess aganst the real ChatGPT, this program taught me a lot about planning software, readable code, and clear structure.

I have also worked on many other smaller projects, which you can find in my compilation "I Hope You Can Run C", and open-sourced in different repositories on my Github.
