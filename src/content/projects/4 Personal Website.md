It's a rite of passage for everyone with even a passing interest in technology to make their own website. My training has been more back-end development, in languages like C, C++, and Python, so web development was quite unfamiliar to me.

I was able to find a usable template online, primarily using the Astro language, a superset of HTML, in combination with CSS, typescript, and markdown interfaces. I was completely uninitiatied to all of these languages, so it was a fun challenge to first of all understand these languages, and then begin tweaking the template to meet my own needs.

I also had to develop a workstyle to efficiently update the website, which was done via IDX and netlify. I had to quickly pick up how to use these tools, which was a very fun challenge.
