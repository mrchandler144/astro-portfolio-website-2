Following my third year, I was offered a summer internship position at Fisher & Paykel Healthcare. I joined the Non-Invasive Ventillation (NIV) team, and was promptly given my own project to look after. It involved improving internal team resources, product testing, and working across teams to create deliverables.

It was an absolutely incredible experience being able to work for such an important company and being able to put the skills I have accumulated to use. The wider team were incredibly supportive, and I felt like I had every opportunity to learn and grow.
