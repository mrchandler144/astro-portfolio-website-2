Over the summer of 2023-2024, I was fortunate enough to land an internship with New Zealand Steel. I was placed in the paintline, helping facilitate production of COLORSTEELÂ®.

I was tasked to independently complete some distinct tasks during my internship, and took the initiative to complete some self-directed projects. My most important project was a process to increase saftey for the operators at the paint head by installing a nip bar. This process was incredibly interesting, combining 3D CAD and real-world manufacturing to deliver a robust end product. I was able to oversee the installation before I left.

I took ownership of many other projects, including an effort to reduce paint splatter at the paint heads, a visit to our chemical supplier, creation and distribution of a system to report near misses, and the delivery of 3D printed hooks to assist in the paint change routine.

I learnt a lot from this internship, such as obviously what industry is like out beyond the university campus. One of the biggest takeaways though, was the soft skills that are needed in every workplace. Building friendly relationships with the operators, the engineering team, and people in other plants was incredibly rewarding, and the results I delivered where only possible because of that collaboration.
